Font Awesome - Icon Search Tool ( for Version 3.2.1 )
---

This is a tool for making it easier to find the icons you are looking for and quickly copy the code you need.

The main Font Awesome library is accessible here: [http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)

Purpose:
---
Font Awesome is an amazing tool, it just needs a little UX love.  For example, lets say you search their main Icon page... good luck copying the text you need for that icon ;) You have to click the icon, taking you to the detail for that icon, then you have to click back and you loose where you were on the page and have to start all over. You can, of course, use the cheat sheet but then you loose the ability to view it in a different size, and the list on that page does not have links to take you to the detail of that icon.  It's just enough to drive me crazy, and since I love the hell out of Font Awesome, I wanted to help ;)

The main issue I found is if you wanted to know the icons that came out in version 3.1 vs 3.2, or ones that were only available in 1.0.  This is kind of a big deal for designers who work for larger companies that are stuck using older versions of Font Awesome.  They may, for example, be stuck on Version 2.0 and their team wants to know which icons they can use.  Using the Font Awesome website, you would have to click each icon you wanted and then see which release it came out with, for each icon you wanted to look at using. That would suck to have to do with the 300+ icons they now have. With this tool, that process is near instant for ALL icons available.

* [http://j.mp/fasearch](http://j.mp/fasearch) - A shorter, easier version to remember ( Think [f]ont [a]wesome [search] = __fasearch__  )

Usage:
---
* __Search:__ Looks for text in any icon and possible aliases. Example: searching for "empty" ( without quotes ) will find you everything containing that word. Another Example: "yen" will return icon-jpy even through its not the icons name.

* __Auto-complete:__ As you type in the search box, an auto-complete list will drop down with possible selections matching your search.  Clicking on a selection, or using the arrows & enter key will activate that selection.

* __Version Filters:__ If you would like to limit your search results to Icons released in a certain version, change the "All Versions" drop down menu to a version you would like to filter by.  If you just want to see icons that came out in that version, make sure your search term is empty and pick a version from that list.

* __Category Filters:__ If you would like to limit your search results to Icons in a specific category, change the "All Categories" drop down menu to a category you would like to filter by.  If you just want to see icons that belong to that category, make sure your search term is empty and pick a category from that list.

* __Search & Filters Combinations:__ Any Filters you use will reduce the matches shown in the results.

* __Keyboard Navigation:__ You can use the left and right arrows keys to jump to the previous / next visible icon in the list.  If you want to move more quickly, you can also use the up and down arrows to jump three items at a time.  At any time you can hit the escape key to reset everything.

Make sure you do not have any filters set as they will limit results that are listed.
