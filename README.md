Font Awesome - Icon Search Tool ( for Version 3.2.1 )
---

This is a tool for making it easier to find the icons you are looking for and quickly copy the code you need.

The main Font Awesome library is accessible here: [http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)

Demo:

* [http://lab.peterschmalfeldt.com/fontawesome/](http://lab.peterschmalfeldt.com/fontawesome/)

* [http://j.mp/fasearch](http://j.mp/fasearch) - A shorter, easier version to remember ( Think [f]ont [a]wesome [search] = __fasearch__  )

Usage:
---
* __Search:__ Looks for text in any icon and possible aliases. Example: searching for "empty" ( without quotes ) will find you everything containing that word. Another Example: "yen" will return icon-jpy even through its not the icons name.

* __Auto-complete:__ As you type in the search box, an auto-complete list will drop down with possible selections matching your search.  Clicking on a selection, or using the arrows & enter key will activate that selection.

* __Version Filters:__ If you would like to limit your search results to Icons released in a certain version, change the "All Versions" drop down menu to a version you would like to filter by.  If you just want to see icons that came out in that version, make sure your search term is empty and pick a version from that list.

* __Category Filters:__ If you would like to limit your search results to Icons in a specific category, change the "All Categories" drop down menu to a category you would like to filter by.  If you just want to see icons that belong to that category, make sure your search term is empty and pick a category from that list.

* __Search & Filters Combinations:__ Any Filters you use will reduce the matches shown in the results.

* __Keyboard Navigation:__ You can use the left and right arrows keys to jump to the previous / next visible icon in the list.  If you want to move more quickly, you can also use the up and down arrows to jump three items at a time.  At any time you can hit the escape key to reset everything.

Make sure you do not have any filters set as they will limit results that are listed.
